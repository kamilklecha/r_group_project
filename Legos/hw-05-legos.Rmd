This week we'll do some data gymnastics to refresh and review what we learned over the past few weeks using (simulated) data from Lego sales in 2018 for a sample of customers who bought Legos in the US.

# Getting started

Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your homework repo, clone it in RStudio and open the R Markdown document.
Knit the document to make sure it compiles without errors.
Do something else too. [Git test!]
And another thing! [Another test]

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.
Update the YAML of your R Markdown file with your information, knit, commit, and push your changes.
Make sure to commit with a meaningful commit message.
Then, go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files.
If anything is missing, commit and push again.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation and the data lives in the **dsbox** package.
These packages are already installed for you.
You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

## Data

The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it's called `lego_sales`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.
You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?lego_sales` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `lego_sales`.
You can also find this information [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/lego_sales.html).

# Exercises

Answer the following questions using pipelines.
For each question, state your answer in a sentence, e.g. "In this sample, the first three common names of purchasers are ...".
Note that the answers to all questions are within the context of this particular sample of sales, i.e. you shouldn't make inferences about the population of all Lego sales based on this sample.

1.  What are the three most common first names of purchasers?


In this sample, the three common first names of purchasers are Jackson, Jacob, Joseph

2.  What are the three most common themes of Lego sets purchased?


In this sample, the three most common themes of Lego sets purchased are Star Wars, Nexo Knights, Gear, and Mixels

3.  Among the most common theme of Lego sets purchased, what is the most common subtheme?


In this sample, the most common theme of Lego sets purchased is Star Wars, and the most common subtheme is The Force Awakens

```{marginfigure}
**Hint:** Use the `case_when()` function.
```

4.  Create a new variable called `age_group` and group the ages into the following categories: "18 and under", "19 - 25", "26 - 35", "36 - 50", "51 and over".

```{r echo=FALSE}
lego_sales <- lego_sales %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age <= 18 ~ "18 and under",
    age >= 19 & age <= 25 ~ "19 - 25",
    age >= 26 & age <= 35 ~ "26 - 35",
    age >= 36 & age <= 50 ~ "36 - 50",
    age >= 51 ~ "51 and over"
  ))
```

5.  Which age group has purchased the highest number of Lego sets.

```{r echo=FALSE}
lego_sales %>%
  count(age_group, sort = TRUE)
```

In this sample group of 36-50 yo purchased the highest number of Lego sets.

6.  Which age group has spent the most money on Legos?

```{r echo=FALSE}
lego_sales %>%
  mutate(
    amount_spent = us_price * quantity
  ) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    total_spent = sum(amount_spent)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_spent))
```

In this sample group of 36-50 yo has spent the most money on Legos.

7.  Which Lego theme has made the most money for Lego?

```{r echo=FALSE}
lego_sales %>%
  mutate(
    amount_spent = us_price * quantity
  ) %>%
  group_by(theme) %>%
  summarise(
    total_spent = sum(amount_spent)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_spent))
```

In this sample Star Wars has made the most money for Lego

8.  Which area code has spent the most money on Legos?
    In the US the area code is the first 3 digits of a phone number.

```{r echo=FALSE}
lego_sales %>%
  mutate(
    amount_spent = us_price * quantity
  ) %>%
  group_by(substr(phone_number, 1, 3)) %>%
  summarise(
    total_spent = sum(amount_spent)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_spent))  
```  

In this sample area code of 956 (state of Texas) has spent the most money on Legos
    

9.  Come up with a question you want to answer using these data, and write it down.
    Then, create a data visualization that answers the question, and explain how your visualization answers the question.
